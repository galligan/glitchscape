## Musical Approach

- Adaptive soundtrack that shifts between "glitched" and "restored" versions
- Base compositions in chiptune style with progressive instrumental layering as worlds heal
- World-specific motifs that incorporate thematic elements
- Leitmotifs for Patch, Hack, and the Supervisor that evolve throughout the game

## Sound Effect Philosophy

| Category | Glitched State | Restored State |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| **Player Movement** | Slight distortion, occasional artifacts | Clean, responsive feedback |
| **Combat Impacts** | Harsh bit-crushed noise | Clear, satisfying hits |
| **Environmental** | Low-bit ambient hum, digital anomalies | Harmonious background elements |
| **UI/Menus** | Noise-gate clicks, pitch variance | Precise, consistent tones |

## Voice Approach

- No traditional voice acting
- Character "voices" expressed through unique sound patterns
- Patch: Warm, harmonious tones
- Hack: Distorted, inverted versions of Patch's sounds
- The Supervisor: Clean, synthetic speech patterns

## Dynamic Audio Restoration

- Each cleared corruption node gradually transforms audio in that area
- Bit depth increases from 8-bit to 16-bit quality
- Distortion filters fade out progressively
- Muted frequency ranges gradually open up
- Background ambience evolves from chaotic to ordered
- Interactive elements like platforms and mechanisms gain clearer audio feedback
- Sound propagation behavior normalizes (echo, reverb, spatial characteristics)

## Supervisor/Backdoor Audio Environment

- Clean, high-fidelity audio free from corruption
- Ambient hum of stable system processes
- Subtle UI feedback tones for interaction
- Gentle activation/deactivation sounds for upgrades
- Data transfer audio when receiving enhancements
- Special "secure connection" tone when entering and exiting
