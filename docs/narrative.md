## Setting & Premise

**THE CORE ENGINE**: A powerful game development system managed by a benevolent AI Supervisor. When critical bugs emerged across multiple game-worlds, the AI spawned a helper subprocess called Patch to fix the corruption. However, this action inadvertently created Hack - a corrupted mirror of Patch with the same core abilities but twisted purpose.

**THE WORLDS**: Eight distinct game environments built with the Core Engine, each with their own aesthetic, mechanics, and characters. Hack has infected all worlds, transforming them into glitched versions of their intended design.

**THE CONFLICT**: Patch must journey through each world, purging corruption, restoring game integrity, and collecting Glitch Powers to eventually confront Hack at the System Core.
