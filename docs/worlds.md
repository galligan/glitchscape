## The Nine Game-Worlds

| # | Theme | Original Game Title | Guardian (Original → Corrupted) | Power Gained | Unique World Elements |
|---|-------|-------|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Nature / Forest | Arboria: Guardians of the Grove | Rootweaver → Ursa Ultra | **Earthquake Stomp** – Seismic attack creating shockwaves that affect terrain and enemies | Season Shift Zones that toggle environmental properties |
| 2 | Fantasy Ice | Frostbound Realms | Pyralis → Hexragon | **Freeze Frame** – Projects ice beams that temporarily freeze enemies and objects in time | Sky-bound crystal realm with aurora bridges, no falling hazards |
| 3 | Sandbox Builder | Blockworld | Architect Prime → Void Architect | **Block Assembly** – Creates temporary platforms, stairs, bridges, and structures | Physics Anomalies with altered gravity, time flow, and material properties |
| 4 | Time Lab | Chronos Station | Dr. Tempus → Dr. Möbius | **Temporal Anchor** – Set marker; world rewinds except Patch | Wormhole Transit network for Portal-like transportation |
| 5 | Archive Library | Lost Archives: Digital Expedition | Codex → Omnilex | **Knowledge Extraction** – Absorbs properties from environment/enemies temporarily | Translation Puzzles requiring deciphering ancient inscriptions |
| 6 | Water World | Abyssal Protocol | Leviathan → Ultralodon | **Hydro-Stream** – Controls streams of code-infused water for movement and manipulation | Bioluminescent Guidance systems revealing hidden paths |
| 7 | Fire Mountain | Volcanic Forge | Magmar → Meltdown | **Thermal Manipulation** – Adjusts temperature of specific objects or areas | Pressure Vents network for traversal and puzzle solving |
| 8 | Wild West | Digital Frontier | Sheriff Protocol → The Enforcer | **Quantum Lasso** – Energy rope functioning as binding tool and grappling hook | Digital western motifs (wire tumbleweeds, glitching horses, impossible saloons) |
| 9 | System Core | Core Protocol | N/A → Hack | **All Powers** – Final confrontation with Hack who wields corrupted versions of all powers | Access Level Gates requiring specific power combinations |

## World Details

### Forest World: Arboria: Guardians of the Grove
- Original Concept: A serene exploration game where players would nurture a magical forest ecosystem
- Aesthetic: Digital Evolution - Forest in mid-transformation between digital and natural states with areas cycling between high-fidelity nature and low-bit pixel art
- Guardian: Ursa Ultra - Transparent bear with constellation patterns within its body, multiple overlapping outlines suggesting movement in several timelines
- Power: Earthquake Stomp - Seismic attack that creates shock waves, transforms terrain temporarily, and stuns enemies
- Unique Elements: Season Shift Zones where seasonal effects can be toggled, changing environment properties (winter freezes water, spring grows platforms, etc.)

### Fantasy Ice World: Frostbound Realms
- Original Concept: Epic fantasy adventure where players controlled a powerful mage seeking elemental balance
- Aesthetic: Fractured Enchantment - Fantasy realm shattered across multiple floating islands in various states of magical decay
- Guardian: Hexragon - Serpentine ice dragon composed of thousands of animated ice shards that reconfigure as it moves
- Power: Freeze Frame - Projects ice beams that temporarily freeze enemies and objects in time, creating ice platforms on water surfaces
- Unique Elements: Sky-bound crystal realm with shimmering ice formations, platforms connected by aurora bridges, magical currents preventing fatal falls

### Sandbox Builder World: Blockworld
- Original Concept: Creative construction game where players could build structures using various block types
- Aesthetic: Blueprint Dimension - Environment appears as mix of completed structures and translucent blueprint projections with visible grid lines
- Guardian: Void Architect - Massive humanoid figure assembled from disparate block types with glowing code stitching incompatible pieces together
- Power: Block Assembly - Creates temporary platforms, stairs, bridges, and simple structures with varying properties
- Unique Elements: Physics Anomalies where normal physics rules are altered (gravity changes direction, time flows differently for objects)

### Time Lab World: Chronos Station
- Original Concept: Sci-fi adventure set aboard an advanced space station researching temporal anomalies
- Aesthetic: Dimensional Research Facility - Clean, futuristic lab with wormhole effects and sections phasing between dimensions
- Guardian: Dr. Möbius - Human scientist whose body has become temporally unstable, appearing at different ages simultaneously
- Power: Temporal Anchor - Ability to set reference points and rewind time while Patch retains position and collected items
- Unique Elements: Wormhole Transit network of portal-like connections serving as transportation between sections of the station

### Archive Library World: Lost Archives: Digital Expedition
- Original Concept: Archaeological adventure exploring a vast repository of knowledge spanning multiple civilizations
- Aesthetic: Ancient Digital Library - Vast halls with towering bookshelves, data obelisks, and classical architecture with technological components
- Guardian: Omnilex - Humanoid figure in scholarly robes with circuit patterns and multiple arms holding different information tools
- Power: Knowledge Extraction - Absorbs properties from environment or enemies temporarily, similar to Marvel's Taskmaster
- Unique Elements: Translation Puzzles requiring deciphering ancient inscriptions to unlock paths and reveal hidden lore

### Water World: Abyssal Protocol
- Original Concept: Underwater exploration adventure discovering a vast digital ocean ecosystem
- Aesthetic: Digital Coral Network - Vast underwater environment where data manifests as bioluminescent coral formations with flowing information currents
- Guardian: Ultralodon - Massive whale shark entity with bioluminescent circuit patterns running along its body
- Power: Hydro-Stream - Generates and controls streams of code-infused water for traversal, puzzle-solving, and combat
- Unique Elements: Bioluminescent Guidance from living light sources that reveal hidden paths when nearby, with different colors indicating different secrets

### Fire Mountain World: Volcanic Forge
- Original Concept: Action-adventure in an active volcanic region home to an ancient crafting civilization
- Aesthetic: Active Codeforge - Volcanic mountain with rivers of flowing data-lava and forge facilities built into the mountainside
- Guardian: Meltdown - Massive volcanic rock creature with large boulders connected by flowing lava code serving as joints
- Power: Thermal Manipulation - Adjusts the temperature of specific objects or areas, creating paths through hazards
- Unique Elements: Pressure Vents network that can be activated or redirected for vertical traversal and powering ancient mechanisms

### Wild West World: Digital Frontier
- Original Concept: Open-world western adventure as a legendary peacekeeper in a vast frontier data landscape
- Aesthetic: Corrupted Frontier Town in perpetual sunset transitioning to sundown, with buildings glitching between states
- Guardian: The Enforcer - Sheriff figure existing in multiple probability states simultaneously with overlapping translucent forms
