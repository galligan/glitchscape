## Executive Summary

**Glitchscape** is a fast-paced 2D/2.5D platformer that fuses the boss-centric progression of **Mega Man**, the ability-gated exploration of **Metroid**, the temporal mechanics of **Braid**, and the digital aesthetic of **Tron/The Matrix**.

Set inside a game engine managed by a benevolent AI, players control **Patch**, a helper program created to fix bugs. However, the AI accidentally created **Hack** - Patch's corrupted mirror - who now spreads glitches throughout connected game-worlds. Patch must navigate eight distinct game environments, restore them to their original state, and ultimately confront Hack in the system core.
